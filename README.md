### Overview

This project is a part of the **first** year of Epitech. <br>
We had **1 month** to complete it. :spiral_calendar: <br>

The goal of this project was to create a **RPG game** in **C** with the **CSFML library**. :video_game:<br>

### Features

* `u`: Skip the cut scene
* `i`: Open inventory
* `esc`: Open menu
* `w`: Quit the game
* `z`: Go forward
* `s`: Go backward
* `q`: Go left
* `d`: Go right
* `p`: Player's stat
* `t`: Open skill tree

### Running the project locally

* Clone this repository locally
* Run `make` in your bash / command line
* Run `./my_rpg` <br>

<br>

> **Warning**
> Make sure the CSFML library is installed or the program won't work.

To try this program, you can to use this **command** to automatically play the game and when you quit it, clean the repository: <br>
